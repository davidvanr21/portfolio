# Portfolio 2021 - David van Rumpt
This is my ReadME. It contains the case I'm working on with all the research and resources I've used. Enjoy!

Functional Programming is part of the Tech Treck of CMD Amsterdam 2020. It's a 6-week cycle with focus on visualising data with code. FP is given the first 2 weeks of the total course. To see my whole learning process and iterations, go to my [wiki](https://github.com/davidvanr21/functional-programming/wiki). Here, in my ReadME, you can read my main findings and decisions
